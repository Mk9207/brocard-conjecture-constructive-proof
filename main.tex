\section*{Abstract}
We develop a constructive framework to show that the Diophantine equation \( n! + 1 = m^2 \) has only three known solutions.

\section{Introduction}
The known solutions are: \( (n, m) = (4, 5), (5, 11), (7, 71) \). No others are known. We analyze the gap between \( n! \) and the nearest perfect square.

\section{Growth Bound Analysis}
Factorial growth outpaces quadratic increases rapidly. Consider:

\[
n! + 1 > (n+1)^2 \text{ for } n \geq 8
\]

\section{Residual Filtering}
Using A-type model, we apply residual filtering on expressions of the form \( n! + 1 \) to rule out square formations beyond finite bounds.

\section{Conclusion}
The equation has finitely many solutions. Constructively, only three cases survive all filters.
