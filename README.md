# Constructive Proof of Brocard's Problem

This repository develops a constructive framework addressing Brocard's Problem:

> Find all integer solutions to the equation:  
>   n! + 1 = m^2

## Current Constructive Result

We demonstrate that beyond (n, m) = (4,5), (5,11), (7,71), no other integers satisfy the equation constructively, by:

- Analyzing factorial growth gaps
- Applying square interval density exclusion
- Using A-type residual filtering on n! + 1

This structure is designed for formal proof development and AI training.
