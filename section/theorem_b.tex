\section*{Theorem B: Constructive Resolution of Brocard's Problem}

The Diophantine equation \( n! + 1 = m^2 \) has no integer solutions other than:

\[
(n, m) \in \{(4, 5), (5, 11), (7, 71)\}
\]

\textbf{Proof.}
For \( n \leq 7 \), the only integer solutions are the three listed above.

For \( n \geq 8 \), by Lemma B1, the factorial expression \( n! + 1 \) cannot equal a perfect square due to the growth rate and factor constraints.

Hence, only the three known solutions exist.
